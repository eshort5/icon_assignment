	The COVID-19 pandemic has been over a year ravaging the nation, with New York City acting as an epicenter for not only the country, but the world, at one point in time. Thousands died, and as time passed, a different kind of crisis emerged — hunger.  Food insecurity is an issue that has impacted many New Yorkers already, but has only gotten worse since the onslaught of the pandemic. Examining Queens borough provides further insight into the issue.

	<i>Approximately 47.2% of Queens residents are foreign-born, and Queens is one of the most diverse boroughs in New York, with Hispanic or Latino populations at 28%, Asian populations at 25.3%, white populations at 25%, and Black or African-American populations at 17.12%. Food insecurity is well documented to hit communities of color the hardest.</i>

<p>
	In order to combat food insecurity, government assistant programs like SNAP (food stamps) food pantries, and even local organizations act as relief for those in need.

	 <i>As of 2020, 318,050 individuals, or 190,869 households, received food stamps. Foodpantries.org lists 27 food pantries currently operating in Queens.</i>

	Food insecurity among children is another dimension to an already troubling problem. In a city where 1 in 4 children are projected to go hungry, the pandemic has made matters worse.

	<i>In the last year, the number of food insecure children in New York City increased from approximately 317,840 to 521,000. In Queens, about 121,000 children went without enough food, a sharp increase from the 65,440 children in 2018. It’s projected that child food insecurity will be at 22% for 2021.</i>

	Several community fridges exist as a way for neighbors to both give and receive help to fellow community members. There currently are over 20 fridges actively running in Queens. One fridge arose during the pandemic when a community organization saw a need for access to food.

	<i>The Ridgewood Tenants Union set up a fridge at 955 Seneca Ave in Ridgewood, as a direct result of residents needing access to food as a result of the pandemic. The local juice bar pays the electricity to keep the fridge operational.</i>
